# Metrics 

## SSD and PNSR 

## Pixel based

## Probabilistics ones

## Bhattacharyya

Probability metrics based on density (using SSD)

## Subjective comparison

### Constraints

  * Human deetction is'nt reliable
  * All patches are visualy close

**Solution** : 

  * 
  
## Conclusion : 

  * Bh2 = the 2nd Bhattacharyya probability sensity based metric
  * Similarity metric method most relevant compared to subjective selection
  * Best looking result on denoising application
